# Principles of imaging and laboratory spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of the wavelength
or frequency of the radiation… analysis of measured reflected, transmitted or absorbed light as a function of wavelength.

## Spectroscopy fundamentals
Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation
as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation… analysis of measured
reflected, transmitted or absorbed light as a function of wavelength.

### Spectral signature
Spectral signature is the variation of reflectance or emittance of a material with respect
to wavelengths (i.e., reflectance/emittance as a function of wavelength).

## Hyperspectral imaging
Hyperspectral imaging, like other spectral imaging, collects and processes information
from across the electromagnetic spectrum. While the human eye sees colors of visible light,
hyperspectral imaging divides the spectrum intu many bands with fine wavelength resolution
and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging also measures continuous
spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.
